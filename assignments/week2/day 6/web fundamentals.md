How the Web Works
When you type a website address, your browser asks a DNS server to translate it into an IP address. Then it connects to that server over HTTP or the secure version, HTTPS. The server responds with files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and your browser renders them into the page you see.

HTML5 Semantic Elements & Accessibility
HTML5 introduced tags like <header>, <article>, <nav>, <footer> that give meaning to content instead of just structure. This makes pages easier to read for screen readers, improves SEO, and creates more organized markup.

CSS3 Fundamentals
Modern CSS uses Flexbox and Grid to arrange layouts without messy hacks. Flexbox is great for aligning items in one direction, while Grid handles two-dimensional layouts. Add responsive design principles (like media queries and relative units) to make sites adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.
