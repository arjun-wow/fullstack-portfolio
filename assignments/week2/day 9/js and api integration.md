Fetch API and HTTP Requests
The Fetch API lets you make HTTP requests from the browser to get or send data. It’s modern and promise-based, so you can handle asynchronous requests easily.

Working with JSON Data
Most APIs send and receive data in JSON. You can parse JSON into JavaScript objects to use in your code or convert objects back to JSON when sending data.

Error Handling for API Calls
It’s important to handle errors, like network failures or bad responses. You can use .catch() or try/catch blocks to manage errors and show fallback messages to users.

Basic Debugging Techniques
Debugging helps find and fix issues in web apps. You can use browser developer tools, console logs, breakpoints, and inspecting network requests to see what’s happening and why something isn’t working.
