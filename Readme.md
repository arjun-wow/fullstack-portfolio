Version control & tools
My goal is to master Git and GitHub, focusing on the GitFlow branching strategy. I will use ESLint, Prettier, and Husky to ensure my code is professional and clean before every commit.

Full-Stack development
I will build a full-stack application. I'll develop a RESTful API using Node.js and Express and connect it to a PostgreSQL or MongoDB database for CRUD operations. I will build the user interface using React to handle state and API requests.

Deployment & production
I will learn to deploy my complete application to platforms like Vercel or Render, making my projects live. I will also implement security practices to protect my applications and manage environment variables.
